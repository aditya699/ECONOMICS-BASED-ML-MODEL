## ABOUT PROJECT

We live in times where stress rules our mind. Often it gets ignored and no one payâ€™s attention 
To. We try to model ladder score (thatâ€™s indicating how happy you are) using regression based approach. The final model that was build use two features one economic (LOG GDP PER CAPITA)    and other non economic (PERCEPTION OF CORRUPTION) . Random forest regressor was used and we got a accuracy of about 70%.
In the due course of the paper the reader will get a understanding of how and why modeling Happiness index ( in the form of ladder score ) .Gives country an idea of how they can improve their ladder score to top the global ranking and make their citizens happy.
