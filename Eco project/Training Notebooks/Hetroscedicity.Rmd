# // GRAPHICAL METHOD 
par(mfrow=c(2,2)) # init 4 charts in 1 panel
plot(model_1)
```
```{r}
# so here you can see in the first picture a almost flat line(NOT FULLY ) was obtained so prima facie our data doesn't suffer from hetoscadicity

```

```{r}
# LETS RUN A GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS ON THE TRANSOFORMED DATA
model_2=lm(data_1$Life.Ladder~.,data=data_1)
par(mfrow=c(2,2)) # init 4 charts in 1 panel
plot(model_2)

```
```{r}
# IN THE TRANSFORMED DATA YOU CAN SEE THAT ALMOST A FINE LINE IS OBTAINED


```

```{r}
# NOW LETS APPLY Breush-Pagan test TO THE DATASET
lmtest::bptest(model_1)  # Breusch-Pagan test

```

```{r}
# VERY INTRESTING OBSERVATION COMING OUR WAY THAT THE GRAPH AND THE TWO TESTS GIVE DISTINCT RESULTS

```

```{r}
# OK SO NCV TEST AND Breusch-Pagan test ARE GIVING CONTRADICTORY RESULTS
# BUT SEEING THE GRAPH WHERE WE CAN SEE THE RED LINE IS ALMOST STRAIGT AND THEREFORE NO HETROSCADICITY IS CONFIRMED
 
```

```{r}
# THIS IS REASON WHILE DEPLOYMENT WE JUST CHOSE A ECONOMIC AND A NON ECONOMIC VARIABLE 
# 1. NO HETROSCADICTY
# 2. NO MULTICOLLINEARITY
# 3. EASY FOR USER OF THE APPLICATION
```

```{r}

model_2=lm(data_1$Life.Ladder~.,data=data_1)
par(mfrow=c(2,2)) # init 4 charts in 1 panel
plot(model_2)
```
```{r}
car::ncvTest(model_2)
```
```{r}
# SO THERE IS HETROSCADCITY IN THE TRANSFORMED DATASET SO  WE ALL THE RECALL THE STATEMENT -
# REMIDY IS DANGEROUS THAN THEN CURE 
# IN ORDER TO GET NORMALITY OUR TRANSFORMED DATA SET HAS HETROSCEDICITY
# SO THAT IS WHY THE THE TRANSOFORMED FEATURES WEREN;T USED IN THE FINAL FEATURES MOREOVER I PERSONALLY FELL OVER TRASNFORMATIONS MIGHT NOT BE GREAT IN BUSSINESS SENSE SINCE THEIR INTERPRETABLITY IS LOW
